# Neuron Unit Optimization Results

Essentially a feature frozen version of the NeuronUnit/Sciunit with NSGA Optimization. The idea is that this repository acts as a seperate branch of neuronunit, a branch where changes to neuronunit/sciunit are not merged in, and therefore plottable results are always readily obtainable for various publications.
